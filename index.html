    <h3>ðŸš€ My Story: Why I Built Franklin</h3>
    <p>
      It started when I realized that unless I constantly upload files, AI canâ€™t work with anything on my machine.<br><br>
      Most tools today are designed for one-off chats, not real work. You paste in a prompt, get a response, and itâ€™s gone. No memory, no local tools, no privacy â€” and no control. I didnâ€™t want a chatbot. I wanted a partner. Something that could help me build, debug, automate, and organize â€” the way I work, on my terms, and on my machine.<br><br>
      So I built Franklin â€” my first real solo project, developed in my spare time, late nights and weekends. Itâ€™s still a work in progress â€” but itâ€™s already different from most AI tools Iâ€™ve tried.<br><br>
      Franklin lives on your machine â€” where your files are. It can read them, summarize them, and act on them. It speaks plain language and respects your privacy.<br><br>
      By default, Franklin runs in hybrid mode, combining fast, high-quality cloud models with local tools and fallback logic. When privacy matters most, you can switch to local-only mode â€” keeping everything on your device. You stay in control.<br><br>
      No uploading. No surveillance. Just real work â€” done on your terms.<br><br>
      What started as a personal experiment became something more: a local-first AI operating system for power users, creators, devs, and tinkerers â€” like me.<br><br>
      Franklin isnâ€™t for everyone. But if youâ€™re the kind of person who builds your own tools, runs your own server, or just wants to own your AI â€” Franklin was built for you.<br><br>
      <strong>Welcome aboard.</strong>

    <h3>ðŸ‘¤ About the Creator</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Brent â€” the solo builder behind Franklin.<br><br>
      I donâ€™t work in IT. I donâ€™t have formal qualifications. Iâ€™m not a developer by trade. Iâ€™m just a tinkerer â€” someone who loves learning, breaking things, fixing them, and figuring out how it all works.
      <br><br>
      Franklin is my first real project. I started it as a side hobby, and it slowly grew into something bigger. I built it from the ground up â€” writing code, wiring up containers, debugging crashes, and testing everything myself. Nights, weekends, whenever I had a moment to spare.
      <br><br>
      Itâ€™s still evolving. Iâ€™m constantly improving it, fixing things, and adding new features. Thereâ€™s a lot more to come â€” but the core idea is already here: local-first AI that works for you, not some server farm.
      <br><br>
      If you're a builder, a self-hoster, or someone who just likes to have control over your tools â€” welcome. Franklin was made for you.
      <em>â€” Brent (aka dfrank)</em>
